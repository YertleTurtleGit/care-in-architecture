          The graphic is divided into five spectrums, each representing a phase
          of curating planning. Accordingly, the graphic can be read as a
          chronogram in which the individual phases build on each other like a
          planning process. The spectrums are not necessarily linked to each
          other, but can also function independently as a strategy:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Initiate – Learning from the site</li>
          <li>Dialogue – Creating Knowledge</li>
          <li>Coordinate to site conditions – Tentative calibration</li>
          <li>Intervene through care – Transition on site</li>
          <li>Expose – Publishing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition, the process can be divided into ‘Act’ and ‘React’. Act
          describes taking action and can also be understood as activist work.
          ‘React’ describes responding to the previous phase of insight.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scroll-element">
        <h1>2</h1>
        <p>
          The spectrums encompass important strategies and practices that are
          effective mechanisms in the context of curating planning practice. The
          individual orbits show the connection between related aspects.
          However, the arrangement is not specified and can be configured.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scroll-element">
        <h1>3</h1>
        <p>
          Similarly, the connecting lines serve to highlight the interdependence
          within the subject complex. The composition is not to be understood as
          settled, but serves to evoke associations when viewed and is intended
          to encourage further connections to be made.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scroll-element">
        <h1>4</h1>
        <p>
          The orange colored aspects show projects, theories, studios, or
          important individuals listed draw connections to planning practice and
          provide examples of how the practices of curating landscapes can be
          implemented in reality.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scroll-element">
        <h1>5</h1>
        <p>
          In summary, the diagram is not a taxonomy but rather offers a range
          of planning practices that are intended to encourage adaptation in
          practice. The graphic uses a style that is not immediately
          understandable, in order to reflect the complexity of the range of
          topics. Taking interdependencies into account, ‘curating landscapes’
          proposes an iterative design approach that responds to change with
          persistent design processes.
